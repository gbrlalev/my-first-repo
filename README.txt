Second, the Greeks knew from their travels that the Pole Star appeared lower in the sky 
when viewed in the south than it did in more northerly regions. From the difference in 
the apparent position of the Pole Star in Egypt and Greece, Aristotle even quoted an estimate 
that the distance around the Earth was four hundred thousand stadia. It is not known exactly 
what length a stadium was, but it may have been about two hundred yards. This would make 
Aristotle's estimate about twice the currently accepted figure.
